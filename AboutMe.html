            <div id="Methodology">
                <p class="HeaderText">My Name is Teun Weijdener:</p>
                <p>
                    I create creative solutions to tricky problems like: How can we traverse without gps? How can we design an engaging
                    way of collecting trash? And is there a way to create a confetti canon that is compatible with consumable confetti?
                </p>

                <p> 
                    It is in my nature to think out of the box with inside the box materials, or to put it in other words: How 
                    can we solve the problem by combining existing utilities, the result of my method is a fast, realistic and affordable product
                    that is up to modern and future standards.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That is not to say i can't design anything new, i have designed/created multiple projects with new
                    and unproven technology, it is just that my methodology dictates that you should not reinvent the wheel
                    but use different size, tire grip and differently attached wheels to fit the project or use a mix of wheels
                    and tracks so that the car has better grip on the road.
                    <br><br>
                    Tldr: I try to combine already existing technologies where i can and design new ones where needed.

            <div id="SelfIntroduction">
                <p class="HeaderText">But how did i get here?</p>
                <p>
                    Well, to answer that i am first going to tell you a bit more about myself, My name is Teun Weijdener, it has currently been <span id="yearsssincebirth">(amount of years)</span>
                    years since i was born, i have 4 siblings, live in the Netherlands and attend the "Groenehart Lyceum", my current school.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    My main passion is programming which fits in nicely with problem solving since problem solving is 
                    the foundation of programming, i am currently proficient in Python and am in the process of learning Html, Css and Javascript(on which this site is built!).
                    My passion for programming started around <span id="yearssinceprogramming"></span> years ago during the first Covid lockdown and i thought it might be usefull to learn a skill that could
                    benefit me in the long run, i started with Python continue to expand my knowledge!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Other hobby's include: Hockey, reading, cycling and creating youtube montages(see also: What have i created?).
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="CoreQualities">
                <p class="HeaderText">What Am i?</p>

                <p>Core competencies(Kernkwaliteiten in Dutch) are a list of charactaristics to describe a human being, examples may include: Perseverance, Attention to detail and Presenting.
                    Core competencies are used to measure how capable/valuable a person is to the world, i compiled a list of core competencies which i think fit me best:
                </p>
                
                <p class="CoreCompetencies">Perseverance:</p>
                    <p>
                        A project is due tommorow and it's 22:00? Well it seems as though
                        it is time to pull an all nighter again, although it may at first sight just 
                        appear as bad planning a group project can get tangled up in a multitude of ways 
                        and it's your perseverance that decides if you are going to get an A or an C, committing to 
                        something is something i hold in high regards.
                    </p>
                <p class="CoreCompetencies">Presenting:</p>
                    <p>
                        I find it quite fun to peform for an audience and have no problems with stage fright, below is a video of me peforming a presentation about 
                        one of the projects i completed in front of around 150 parents and chilren, as you can see i am quite comfortable in such a position. I 
                        also have quite a rich vocabulary which greatly benefits me with the next competencie ->
                    </p>
                <p class="CoreCompetencies">Leadership:</p>
                    <p>
                        In group projects i often find myself having the role of leader, something others think i am quite capable of.
                        I think that is in part because of my unique way of approaching a roadmap, it mostly boils down to planning ahead 
                        while taking the consequences of certain decisions in mind, for example: When you design something that fits its purpose
                        exactly it takes less time to design but it makes scalabiliy very difficult, the decision to spend a bit more time making the design
                        more competent could benefit you in the long run.
                    </p>

                <p class="CoreCompetencies">Ability to learn:</p>
                    <p>
                        I am quite adaptable and willing to learn, the fact that i made this website almost without any prior knowledge 
                        of web development should serve to emphasize this claim.
